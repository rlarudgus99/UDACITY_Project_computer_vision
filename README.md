# Project: Object Detection in an Urban Environment
<br/><br/>
## 1. Project overview
- Description of the Project
Detection is an algorithm that combines Classification and Localization of objects in an image.<br/>
The purpose of this project is to improve the detection performance of the ssd_resnet50_v1_fpn_640x640_coco17_tpu-8 model in Urban Environment using the TFRecord file provided by Waymo Open Dataset.<br/>
- What we are trying to achieve
Today, Perception plays a very important role in the autonomous driving industry.<br/>
Therefore, we need to design a detection model with high accuracy and fast Inference performance.<br/>
In the real Urban Environment, there are a lot of vehicles and pedestrians.<br/>
In this situation, we proceeded with this project to design a safe and efficient perception model using Deep Learning.<br/><br/>
